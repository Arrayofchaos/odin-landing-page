# odin-landing-page

This is a landing page project built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course.

The goal of this project is to **build an entire webpage from scratch**, using a provided design image as a reference.  
I’m using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **flexbox** to recreate the layout and style as closely as possible but without obsessing over pixel perfection.

## 🗂️ Project Overview

- Build a **new webpage** from a static design image  
- Use provided fonts and colors (with personal tweaks if I want)  
- Replace placeholder text and images with a custom theme (AI Learning Hub)
- Focus on using **flexbox** for layout  
- Google anything and everything I don’t remember !

This project features my own custom AI Learning Hub theme, with content about AI basics and a pretend newsletter sign-up.

## ⚡ Key Skills Practiced

- Structuring a multi-section webpage  
- Styling with external CSS  
- Using **flexbox** for layout and alignment  
- Managing consistent colors, fonts, and spacing  
- Translating a static image into live code  
- Keeping a clean Git workflow

## ✅ Previous Project

I made a [Recipe Page](https://arrayofchaos.github.io/proj-recipes/index.html) as my first HTML/CSS project.  
This landing page is a separate project — bigger, better, and more polished!

## 🚀 Live Demo

Coming soon! (Will link here when deployed on GitHub Pages.)

**Note:** This page is **not** pixel-perfect by design. It’s all about practicing real-world skills: building layouts, styling with flexbox, and getting comfortable Googling the little stuff. Mobile responsiveness isn’t a focus for this project. That’ll come later!
